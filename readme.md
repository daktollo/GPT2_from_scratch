# Building LLM Architectures from Scratch

This project is focused on understanding and reconstructing the GPT-2 architecture to gain a deeper understanding of large language model (LLM) architectures and the attention mechanism. The implementation is inspired by the "Building LLMs from Scratch" series on the Bizuara YouTube channel.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
1. Reconstruct the GPT-2 architecture step by step.
2. Understand the inner workings of LLMs, including the attention mechanism.
3. Experiment with and learn the principles behind transformer-based models.

## Structure
The project will include:
- Implementation of the GPT-2 architecture.
- Detailed comments and explanations for each component.
- Experiments and insights gained during the process.

## Prerequisites
To follow along or contribute to this project, you should have:
- A basic understanding of Python and deep learning.
- Familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Interest in transformer-based architectures.
